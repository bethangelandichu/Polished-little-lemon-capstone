Git notes
Change directories to the folder that has the files you want to push to git.

    run the #git init - command to initialize the git and set the files as local git repository.

    run the  #git add . - to stage the files and get them ready for pushing to the repository

    run the  #git status command to view what you have staged to be pushed

    run the #git commit -m " your message for the commit"

    run the #git remote  add origin "git@github.com:bethangelandichu/scaling-funicular.git"//only ran in the first occurence during pushing to repository.

    run the #git push -u origin main  - this pushes your changes to the repository

research do you need to add URL each time when pushing to git????
