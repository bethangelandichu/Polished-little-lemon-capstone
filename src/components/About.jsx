Little lemon opened in 1995 by two italian
brothers,Adrian and Mario.
Despite the cityâ€™s diversity,the two brothers recognized the
lack of Mediterranean cuisine in Chicago,and
were inspired to bring the flavors of their hometown
in Italy to the people of Chicago. 
The two brothers
continue to oversee the Little Lemon restaurant,nearly
thirty years later.
